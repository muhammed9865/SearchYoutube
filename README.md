# SearchYoutube
I've started to learn Ktor (backend framework using Kotlin botbotb).
Created this simple project to search youtube videos through a simple parameter "query".

## Changes
- Added fetch videos from Youtube.
 Now you can fetch videos from youtube which will return a playable video url, using the video id that you already got from Search

# Run it
Before using to make sure it works, run this command in cmd
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

make sure you are in the directory of the project
