# SearchYoutube
I've started to learn Ktor (backend framework using Kotlin "my  love").
Created this simple project to search youtube videos through a simple parameter "query".

Most of the work was on running the script

# Run it
Before using to make sure it works, run this command in cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt

make sure you are in the directory of the project
